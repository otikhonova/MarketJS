# Repository Guidelines

This project contains a simple web interface for an online electronics store. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files implement the shopping cart, device catalog, and data models.

Use the following conventions when contributing:

- **File organization**: Keep HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in their respective folders. Place data in the `models` folder as JSON.
- **Coding style**: Prefer readable variable names and maintain indentation with four spaces. Avoid trailing whitespace.
- **Testing**: The project does not include automated tests. After making changes, open `index.html` in a browser and verify that pages render and basic cart actions work.
- **Commits**: Provide concise messages explaining the intent of each change.
